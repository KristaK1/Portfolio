This project evaluated people who gamble or play the lottery as a form of entertainment. Using Tableau to evaluate, I created a campaign for Caesarâ€™s Palace in Las Vegas to use in marketing to get more people to visit their property rather than play the lottery. This would also entice guests, as they are promoting a credit when booking.
