The dataset used in this project was used to evaluate the sleep, health, and lifestyle of participants in various occupations. 
The two main questions for this project were 1) What occupation has the highest stress level, and 
2) Based on quality of sleep, what is the average heart rate? I created a few visualizations to help answer these questions- mainly a bar chart and a boxplot. 
The visualizations showed that a Sales Representative had the highest amount of stress, and that the heart rate ranged from 65-85 beats per minute based on stress.
