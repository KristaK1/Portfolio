Overview: Early last year, my mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer and I wanted to research all of the attributes possible about the disease. This dataset evaluates the tumours found in women in Wisonsin, and I am evaluating whether a tumour is benign or malignant based on different attributes. 

Analysis: There were many analysis tools used in this project
Historgrams
Statistical methods
PMF & CDF
Distribution fitting 
Scatter plots
Regression Analysis

Key Findings: After all of the analysis, I found that the area of the tumour was the bigget sign if it was malignant or not. Also, malignant tumours tend to be much larger in size compared to benign. 

Conclusion: This analysis was used to calm some of my personal fear about my mothers diagnosis, however, I hope that the evaluation of statistical methods can help others who are in a similar situation. I am happy to say that my mother is now healthy and cancer free!
