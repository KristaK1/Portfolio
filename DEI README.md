This project used a government dataset that evaluated the salaries and demographics of mothers around the country. After the initial analysis, I used this dataset to launch a DEI campaign to present to corporations. The findings suggest that companies that offered more family assistance would benefit greatly. 
There is a flyer and a presentation visual.
